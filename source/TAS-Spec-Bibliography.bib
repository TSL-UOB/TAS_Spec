	abstract = {Going beyond dyadic (one-to-one) interaction has been increasingly explored in HRI. Yet we lack a comprehensive view on non-dyadic interaction research in HRI. To map out 15 years of works investigating non-dyadic interaction, and thereby identifying the trend of the field and future research areas, we performed a literature review containing all 164 publications (2006-2020) from the HRI conference investigating non-dyadic interaction. Our approach is inspired by the 4C framework, an interaction framework focusing on understanding and categorising different types of interaction between humans and digital artefacts. The 4C framework consists of eight interaction principles for multi-user/multi-artefact interaction categorised into four broader themes. We modified the 4C framework to increase applicability and relevance in the context of non-dyadic human-robot interaction. We identify an increasing tendency towards non-dyadic research (36\% in 2020), as well as a focus on simultaneous studies (85\% from 2006-2020) over sequential. We also articulate seven interaction principles utilised in non-dyadic HRI and provide specific examples. Last, based on our findings, we discuss several salient points of non-dyadic HRI, the applicability of the modified 4C framework to HRI and potential future topics of interest as well as open-questions for non-dyadic research.},

	abstract = {This research presents the design of a board game that explores Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Information Technologies (IT) for the Disaster and Risk Management (DRM) domain. The game aims to support circumspect discussions of issues emerging at cross-border, cross-sector, interoperation and data management such as privacy, trust, accountability, non-discrimination, and security. IsITethical? board game is both a tool and a process of collaboratively building worlds in which ELSI guidance can be discussed, developed further and applied in preferable near futures. The original idea emerged from the research deliverables of the ELSI work package of SecInCoRe (2014--17), a large-scale EU funded research project concerned with IT for DRM Common Information Spaces (CIS). SecInCoRe's first prototype of the game was further developed and tested in the context of IsITethical?Exchange (2017--2019), a UK Research Innovation funded service co-design project, that explores the idea of ethical impact assessment as a creative collaborative process. This paper offers insights from designing and playing of IsITethical? that begun as a project to make ELSI guidance accessible, but that ultimately opened the way for a much bigger journey, including an online community of practitioners, a living knowledge base, a travelling tool kit for ethical impact assessment service, a methodology to do ethics, and the developing of Ethics through Design framework, that both reformulates ideas of Ethics and ideas of Human-Computer Interaction Design.},

	abstract = {Ethics is inherently a multiagent concern. However, research on AI ethics today is dominated by work on individual agents: (1) how an autonomous robot or car may harm or (differentially) benefit people in hypothetical situations (the so-called trolley problems) and (2) how a machine learning algorithm may produce biased decisions or recommendations. The societal framework is largely omitted.To develop new foundations for ethics in AI, we adopt a sociotechnical stance in which agents (as technical entities) help autonomous social entities or principals (people and organizations). This multiagent conception of a sociotechnical system (STS) captures how ethical concerns arise in the mutual interactions of multiple stakeholders. These foundations would enable us to realize ethical STSs that incorporate social and technical controls to respect stated ethical postures of the agents in the STSs. The envisioned foundations require new thinking, along two broad themes, on how to realize (1) an STS that reflects its stakeholders' values and (2) individual agents that function effectively in such an STS.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

	abstract = "AI-based automated decisions are increasingly used as part of new services being deployed to the general public. This approach to building services presents significant potential benefits, such as the reduced speed of execution, increased accuracy, lower cost, and ability to adapt to a wide variety of situations. However, equally significant concerns have been raised and are now well documented such as concerns about privacy, fairness, bias and ethics. On the consumer side, more often than not, the users of those services are provided with no or inadequate explanations for decisions that may impact their lives. In this paper, we report the experience of developing a socio-technical approach to constructing explanations for such decisions from their audit trails, or provenance, in an automated manner. The work has been carried out in collaboration with the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). In particular, we have implemented an automated Loan Decision scenario, instrumented its decision pipeline to record provenance, categorized relevant explanations according to their audience and their regulatory purposes, built an explanation-generation prototype, and deployed the whole system in an online demonstrator.",

	title = "The dual function of explanations: Why it is useful to compute explanations",
	abstract = "Whilst the legal debate concerning automated decision-making has been focused mainly on whether a `right to explanation' exists in the GDPR, the emergence of `explainable Artificial Intelligence' (XAI) has produced taxonomies for the explanation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, various researchers have warned that transparency of the algorithmic processes in itself is not enough. Better and easier tools for the assessment and review of the socio-technical systems that incorporate automated decision-making are needed. The PLEAD project suggests that, aside from fulfilling the obligations set forth by Article 22 of the GDPR, explanations can also assist towards a holistic compliance strategy if used as detective controls. PLEAD aims to show that computable explanations can facilitate monitoring and auditing, and make compliance more systematic. Automated computable explanations can be key controls in fulfilling accountability and data-protection-by-design obligations, able to empower both controllers and data subjects. This opinion piece presents the work undertaken by the PLEAD project towards facilitating the generation of computable explanations. PLEAD leverages provenance-based technology to compute explanations as external detective controls to the benefit of data subjects and as internal detective controls to the benefit of the data controller.",

	abstract={Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness. PROV-DM is the conceptual data model that forms a basis for the W3C provenance (PROV) family of specifications. PROV-DM distinguishes core structures, forming the essence of provenance information, from extended structures catering for more specific uses of provenance. PROV-DM is organized in six components, respectively dealing with: (1) entities and activities, and the time at which they were created, used, or ended; (2) derivations of entities from entities; (3) agents bearing responsibility for entities that were generated and activities that happened; (4) a notion of bundle, a mechanism to support provenance of provenance; (5) properties to link entities that refer to the same thing; and, (6) collections forming a logical structure for its members.
	
	This document introduces the provenance concepts found in PROV and defines PROV-DM types and relations. The PROV data model is domain-agnostic, but is equipped with extensibility points allowing domain-specific information to be included.
	
	Two further documents complete the specification of PROV-DM. First, a companion document specifies the set of constraints that provenance should follow. Second, a separate document describes a provenance notation for expressing instances of provenance for human consumption; this notation is used in examples in this document.}

Traditional approaches to certification require the software, its systems context, and all their associated assurance artifacts to be available for scrutiny in their final, completed forms. But modern development practices often postpone the determination of final system configuration from design time to integration time, load time, or even runtime. Adaptive systems go beyond this and modify or synthesize functions at runtime.",
