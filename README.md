# TAS_Spec

This is the github repository created for the "**On Specifying for Trustworthiness**" journal article. The paper source code is in LaTex. 
The code is hosted at the GitHub account for the Trustworthy Systems Lab (https://github.com/TSL-UOB), University of Bristol. 
This paper is based on the ideas discussed during the "Specifying for Trustworthiness" workshop at the TAS All Hands Meeting on Sep. 15.

We hope to submit this research paper (8 pages) to the Communications of the ACM as a contributed article (https://cacm.acm.org/about-communications/author-center/author-guidelines#2.3.4). As in the workshop, we intend to take a broad view of specification, concentrating on top-level requirements including but not limited to functionality, safety, security, trustworthiness and other non-functional properties. We would also like to leave the discussion on formalisation of these specifications to a future paper, when our understanding of what is required to specify trustworthiness will be more mature.

Please push your edited source files (i.e. .tex and .bib files, any figures) to the repository by **October 31**. 
Also, I would appreciate if you could email to: dhaminda.abeywickrama@bristol.ac.uk when you have uploaded the files. We hope to edit the paper once we receive contributions. 

**Update on November 25, 2021:**

Please note that, we are still waiting for some authors to upload their contributions. Therefore, we thought of using this time to allow all other authors to revise any part of their contributions within the guidelines until **December 8th Wednesday if needed**. We hope to start editing the paper soon after we receive the remaining contributions.
